# Weather App
Weather app is an web-based app to search current weather condition in a certain city across the world. This is a small project that I made to learn API usage. For this project, I use [openweather API for current weather](https://openweathermap.org/current). There are a couple features that I haven't added here :
1. Loading screen while the background is being loaded 
2. Error handling if the user input doesn't match any city (e.g. showing "City not found" text)
